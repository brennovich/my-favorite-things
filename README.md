## My Favorite Things

This project that is named just like [John Coltrane's album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Favorite_Things_(album)) it's an attempt to automate every step of a fresh ArchLinux, Parabola or Debian installation. It assume a custom workflow used by me, and builds an environment with this workflow in mind.

Everything is automated using `make`. There are many utilities and system specific scripts in order to provide seamless integration.

### Usage

You can take advantage of `make` tasks:

```sh
# Install and configure VIm in arch based distro
make Makefile dwm slstatus vim
```

### Preview

Here are a few photos, I'm using a grayscale colorscheme with a deep focus intent:
